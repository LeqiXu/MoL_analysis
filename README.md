# MoL_analysis
This repository contains the code and resources used for simulations and data analyses presented in our paper on the Method of Limits (MoL).

For the detailed pipeline of the MoL method and its comparison with PQLseq, you can find the code and documentation here.

## Overview of MoL
The Method of Limits (MoL) is a novel extension of the method of moments, designed to overcome computational challenges in analyzing count data for GWAS. MoL is particularly advantageous due to its consistency, asymptotic normality, and efficiency in statistical inference, in comparison to existing methods like PQLseq.

## Derectory Description
- **1. Simulation**: This directory includes the scripts used for simulation analyses comparing the performance of MoL and PQLseq.
- **2. Real_Data**: This directory includes the scripts used for applying the MoL method to the UK Biobank data, specifically for analyzing the heritability of weekly champagne and red wine consumption.
